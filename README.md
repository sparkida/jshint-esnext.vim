# jshint.vim esnext

**async await support**
----------------------

This is a work in progress, but we need something more maintainable then the current options

Forked from:
[jshint.vim(wookiehangover)](https://github.com/wookiehangover/jshint.vim)
[jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) flavor of [hallettj's
jslint.vim](https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim).

## Installation

Currently, with Vim + Pathogen

```
npm i --save-dev jshint-esnext.vim
```
